The movie hinted in an *earlier* scene that his fingers were already beginning to rot, when he was in the car and sniffed his fingers that were turning black. Not bleeding (color=red), but black (rotting), and he winces at the smell of his hand. Smell=infected/rotting. \\n\\nYes, it was the wife who instigated (consent âœ“), but the whole point of consent is that consent is maintained throughout the interaction.  So, in bed, his rotting (ROTTING. GROSS) hand is near her face, and she says \"your hand! It\\'s --\" before he muffles her with his dead rotting hand.\\n\\nQuickly breaking that sentence down: \"your hand! It\\'s--\" is clearly a PROTEST, meaning consent is broken.  Without anything layered over it, if he keeps having sex with her while she\\'s trying to talk to him about his hand is already problematic at best.  But the writer doesn\\'t stop there.  \\n\\nContinuing breakdown: Once he hears her protesting, what does he decide to do?  He takes the rotten hand she\\'s already freaked out about and USES IT to figuratively kill two birds with one stone: 1) freak her out even more (power move) by putting rotting flesh ON HER MOUTH, and, in the process, 2) muffles her objection so he doesn\\'t have to hear it.\\n\\nGross and creepy. \\n\\nUnnecessary to the plot.  \\n\\nHis character was already terrible, they could have cut the whole scene and the story would have remained intact.
